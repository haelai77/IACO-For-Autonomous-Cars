# Inverted Ant Colony Optimisation Algorithms For Managing Traffic Congestion + Genetic Algorithm To Optimise


## Abstract
Increasing traffic congestion on roads presents numerous issues for sustainability, infrastructure and safety. As urban populations grow and more people own vehicles, roads become overwhelmed leading to bottlenecks. Cars often consume more fuel and emit higher levels of pollutants. To alleviate these issues, methods involving autonomous vehicles utilising centralised and decentralised communication systems have been proposed as a solution. 

This dissertation presents novel methods of decentralised communication between autonomous cars using swarm intelligence inspired by ground-dwelling insects. The evaluation of these methods employs Monte Carlo simulations of cars travelling across a ``Manhattan-style" network of roads. By adjusting and modifying how agents communicate in the swarm, we were able to analyse the amount of delay experienced on average within each simulation.

The proposed methods of decentralised communication, demonstrated notable performance benefits in terms of congestion handling ability. Initially a ``base" model was implemented for a baseline comparison where in vehicles/agents arbitrarily made routing decisions to reach their destiations.
